* Sun May 30 2004 wore <info@wore.ma.cx> 20040530.3
- I've fprintf debug to find why Access violation occured.
  Normally, on_chunk is called with 1024 samples.
  But, when fb2k crash, on_chunk is called with more than 88200 samples.
  Buffers allocated only 44100 or 48000 samples.
- To fix this bug, I allocate buffer for 5 seconds.
  But it is not good way.
  I'd like to rewrite on_chunk till this weekend.

* Sun May 30 2004 wore <info@wore.ma.cx> 20040530.2
- remove vl=0; in cleanup_buffers and tested it, but still crashes.

* Sun May 30 2004 wore <info@wore.ma.cx> 20040530
